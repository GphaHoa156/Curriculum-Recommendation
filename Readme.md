# Project overview

This project is a solution for Kaggle featured competition Learning Equality - Curriculum Recommendations. You can view more details via this link https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/learning-equality-curriculum-recommendations.

# How it's made:
- Programming language: Python
- Tech used: pretrained models from Huggingface, thus you will want to have a GPU from your computer or cloud via Colab or Kaggle.
- Solution approach:
The solution I used here is **Retrieval and Reranking** pipeline from SentenceTransformer (for more details you can visit the official site https://sbert.net/examples/sentence_transformer/applications/retrieve_rerank/README.html)
